ABOUT:

This is a simple Cookie Clicker mod menu I'm working on

HOW TO USE:

1. Open Cookie Clicker
2. Go to the Navigation bar and TYPE "javascript: "
3. Copy all the code from code.js and paste it after "javascript: "

NOTES:

You MUST type "javascript: " you may not copy and paste it, it will not work if you copy and paste it
You may modify this as long as you don't repost it without a link to this gitub

HELP:

If you can't get the menu working or wan't to request a feature our Discord server is the best place discord.gg/CfeWysN
